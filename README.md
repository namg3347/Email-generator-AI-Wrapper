📧 Email Generator API

An AI-powered Email Generator API built with Java Spring Boot, designed to generate professional, context-aware email responses.
This project demonstrates REST API design, AI integration, secure backend development, and clean code practices.

🚀 What I Built / Skills Demonstrated

Java + Spring Boot → REST API architecture, dependency injection, layered design

AI API Integration → Connected with LLMs (OpenAI/Gemini) for natural language email generation

Custom Email Prompting Engine → Supports tones (formal, casual, friendly, etc.) & additional remarks

Error Handling & Validation → Clean request/response structure

Scalability in Mind → Ready for Chrome extension / Gmail API integration

Version Control & CI/CD Ready → GitHub repo structured for professional deployment

✨ Features

📝 Generate instant professional replies from raw emails

🎭 Choose different tones (formal, casual, friendly, persuasive, etc.)

💬 Add custom remarks for personalization

⚡ REST API endpoints for easy integration

🔒 Future-ready for authentication & SaaS deployment
